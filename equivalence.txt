Q1. Which of the following describe equivalence relations? For those which are not equivalence relations, specify which of ( R,S, and T) fail, and illustrate the failures with examples:
a) L1 parallel to L2 for straight lines in the plane if L1 and L2 are the same or are parallel.
b) L1 perpendicular to L2 for straight lines in the plane if L1 and L2 are perpendicular .
c) p1 similar to p2 for Americans if p1 and p2 live in the same state.
d) p1 ( double tilda) p2 for Americans if p1 and p2 live in the same state or in the neighbouring state
e) p1 ( double tilda) p2 for people if p1 and p2 have a parent in common.
f) p1 congruent p2 for people if p1 and p2 have the same mother.
Q2. For each example of an equivalence relation in Ex 1., describe the members of some equivalence class.
Q3. Let S be a set. Is equality, that is , " = ", an equivalence relation?
Q4. Define the relation ( triple lines) on Z by m( triple line ) n in case m-n is even. Is triple horizontal line an equivalence relation? Explain.
Q5. If G and H are both graphs with vertex set {1,2,...,n}, we say that G is isomorphic to H and write G(line with tilda above ) H, in case tthere is a way to label the vertices of G so that it becomes H. For eg: , the graph in fig 3, with vertex set {1,2,3}, are isomorphic by relabeling function of 1=2, function of 2=3 and function of 3=1.
a. give a picture of another graph isomorphic to these two.
b. Find a graph with vertex set {1,2,3} that is not isomorphic to the graph in figure 3, yet has 3 edges,exactly one of which is a loop.
c. Find another example as in part b that is not isomorphic to the one you found in part b[ or the ones in fig. 3]
d. Show that (line with tilda above ) is an equivalenc relation on the set of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,...,n}.
Q6. Can you think of situations in life where you have used the term "equivalent " and where a natural equivalence relation is involved?
Q7. Define the relation ( double tilda) on Z by m ( double tilda)n in case m^2=n^2
a. Show that ( double tilda is an equivalence relation on Z)
b. Describe the equivalence classes for double tilda. How many are there.
Q8. 
a. For m,n belongs to Z,  define m tilda n in case m-n is odd. Is the relation tilda reflexive? symetric? transitive? Is tilda an equivalence relation?
b. For a, b in R, define a tilda b in case mode of (a-b) <=1. one could say that a tilda b in case a and b are " close enough " or " approximately equal". Answer the question in part a.
Q9. Consider the function g and h mapping Z into n defined by g(n)=|n| and h(n)=1+(-1)^n.
a. Describe the set in the partition {g(<-)(k): k is in the  co domain of g} of Z. How many set are there.
b. Describe the set in the partition {h(<-)(k): k is in the co domain of h} of Z. How many set are there.
Q10. On the set N x N define (m,n) tilda (k,l) if m+l=n+k.
a. Show that tilda is an equivalence relation on N x N
b. Draw a sketch of N x N that shows several equivalence classes.
Q11. Let sigma(doubt) be an alphabet, and for w1 and w2 in sigma* define w1 tilda w2 if length ( w1)=length(w2). Explain why tilda is an equivalence relation, and describe the equivalence classess.
Q12. Let P be a set of computer programmes and regard programmes p1 and p2 as equivalent if they always produce the same output for given inputs. Is this an equivalence relation on P? Explain.
